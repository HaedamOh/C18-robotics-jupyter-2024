Notes on python problem sheet for C18 mobile robotics (M Fallon)
================================================================

The problem sheet is delivered as a Jupyter Python notebook (ipynb). This course was redesigned in Spring 2023 in this manner.

We recommend that students use SageMaker Studio to develop their solutions. A free account is available using your Oxford email address. You should login from here:
https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/login

It is also possible to run Jupiter locally on your own computer.

The original Python problems sheets were developed by Nived Chebrolu and Cyrill Stachniss in University of Bonn. The material is broadly overlapping that used in the previous C18 Mobile Robotics Course.

===== Content =====
There are 5 problem: one problem for each topic in the course with the exception of EKF localisation.

===== Updates =====
1 March 2023
EKF localisation problem removed from problem list

Particle filter problem is optional. If you find the problem sheet please ignore the last problem.
However, the particle filter is the final topic of the lecture slides and is also in the main course material, so I think doing this problem will be helpful for learning the course.


===== FAQ =====

If you have problems running the a2-test notebook, you might be missing core packages, install them within your SageMaker account as follows:

> pip install matplotlib

Other possibly useful commands:

> import numpy as np
> subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", numpy])
